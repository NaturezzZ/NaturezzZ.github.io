I received my B.S. (Summa Cum Laude) from Turing Class at Peking University in 2022. I will pursue my Ph.D. at Peking University from 2022. I was a participant of Physics Olympiad (2015-2018).

I am advised by Prof. [Xin Jin](https://xinjin.github.io/). I also have the priviledge of working with [Ennan Zhai](https://ennanzhai.github.io/) at Alibaba. My research interests are System Building, Data Center Networking and Dataplane Programmability.
