# Projects

## Image to Image Translation with Conditional Adversarial Network (2019.12)
[GitHub](https://github.com/semiwaker/Image-to-Image-Translation-with-Conditional-Adversarial-Network){: .btn }
- This is an implement of [Image to Image Translation with Conditional Adversarial Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.07004) with [tensorlayer 2.0](http://tensorlayer.org).
- As a project of Computing Practice, a PKU course. We used tensorlayer to train a GAN to generate a colored picture with its sketch version.

- This is a open source project based on Guilin Liu et al., M.: Image Inpainting for Irregular Holes Using Partial Convolutions. arXiv preprint arXiv: 1804.07723v2(2018).
- As the project of Introduction to AI, a PKU course, it is a simplified version of the NVIDIA work because of our lack of computing resource but it still makes good performance in most situations.
- There is also a user interface(Simplified Chinese) based on C++ in the folder show and you should put the .pkl file in the corresponding folder.
