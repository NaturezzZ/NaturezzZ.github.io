<p><a href="https://github.com/semiwaker/Image-to-Image-Translation-with-Conditional-Adversarial-Network" class="btn">GitHub</a></p>
<ul>
  <li>This is an implement of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.07004">Image to Image Translation with Conditional Adversarial Network</a> with <a href="http://tensorlayer.org">tensorlayer 2.0</a>.</li>
  <li>As a project of Computing Practice, a PKU course. We used tensorlayer to train a GAN to generate a colored picture with its sketch version.

<ul>
  <li>This is a open source project based on Guilin Liu et al., M.: Image Inpainting for Irregular Holes Using Partial Convolutions. arXiv preprint arXiv: 1804.07723v2(2018).</li>
  <li>As the project of Introduction to AI, a PKU course, it is a simplified version of the NVIDIA work because of our lack of computing resource but it still makes good performance in most situations.</li>
  <li>There is also a user interface(Simplified Chinese) based on C++ in the folder show and you should put the .pkl file in the corresponding folder.</li>
